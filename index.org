#+TITLE: Tiny Packet Programs
#+AUTHOR: Vimalkumar

* What is a Tiny Packet Program?
A *Tiny Packet Program* is a packet with an embedded program that can
read and (optionally) write into switch memory using values stored
within the packet.  It's a highly restrictive, yet useful formulation
of the `Active Networks' vision.

The key idea is to empower end-hosts with _explicit_ network
information to evolve data plane functions in software.

#+CAPTION: Figure 1: A TPP is just another regular packet encapsulated in a TPP header.  The TPP header contains a few instructions that primarily LOAD from and STORE into switch memory.

For now, TPPs are only meant to be used in private networks, and not
across the Internet.

** Why?
Today, there are several network `functions' needed to make any
network work.  These network functions can be broadly divided into
control and data plane functions on the basis of the timescales at
which they operate.  Control plane functions typically operate at
seconds to minutes (e.g., routing, traffic engineering, etc.), whereas
data plane functions operate at packet and round-trip timescales
(e.g., congestion control).

With SDN, the path to introducing new control plane functions is
conceptually clear: Write new software running on commodity servers,
controlling commodity switches through an open interface such as
OpenFlow.

For new data plane functions that typically need hardware support for
performance reasons, the path is less clear.  You are stuck with
whatever your vendor gives you.  Moreover, for tasks such as
congestion control for which there is no _one_ right answer, what do
you do even if you own an ASIC team?

We think TPPs strike a delicate balance between what is possible in
hardware, across vendors, across device characteristics, while being
sufficiently powerful to break the impasse in introducing new data
plane tasks.

** What does it help you do?

In the paper, we show how you can implement the following tasks simply
by having new software at the end-hosts sending specially crafted
TPPs:

- *Congestion control*: Rate Control Protocol (max-min fair version),
  Rate Control Protocol (proportional fair version).

- *CONGA*: A distributed network traffic load balancing mechanism
  available in Cisco's next-generation ASICs.  If you have a
  TPP-enabled network, you can get benefits similar to CONGA just by
  using TPPs.

- *NetSight*: A platform for detailed diagnosis of packet provenance
  in a large network.  You can learn more about NetSight in our NSDI
  2014 paper ([[https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-handigol.pdf][pdf]]).

- *Performance diagnosis*: Identifying links that have high queueing
  occupancy for a short period of time (also known `micro-bursts').

- *High speed, low-overhead monitoring*: A detailed breakdown of
  per-link latency for any specific packet.

We think TPPs are a good fit for a number of other data plane
functions below, but we haven't had a chance to implement them yet:

- *Other congestion control schemes*: [[http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/doc/node238.html][XCP]], [[http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2013/papers/sigcomm/p135.pdf][FCP]], [[https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/35905][QCP]], [[http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2013/papers/hotnets-final92.pdf][MCP]], [[jvimal.github.io/eyeq][EyeQ]], or
  perhaps feeding richer signals into [[http://web.mit.edu/remy/][Remy]].

- *Fast network updates*: If TPPs take half a round-trip time to
  update network state (once the new state is computed, of course),
  can we mitigate the effect of transient network state?

- *DeTail*: Reducing tail latency for flows by quickly switching to
  alternate least-congested paths ([[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dzats/detail.pdf][pdf]]).

- *Packet drop location*: Figuring out exactly where a packet was
  dropped, either due to congestion, or due to corrupted bits.

- *Dynamic flow prioritisation*: Today, flows are prioritised into
  bins statically based on headers.  With TPPs, one can collect finer
  statistics such as link utilisation, flow size distribution (on a
  per-link basis) to dynamically set flow prioritisation thresholds on
  a per-link basis.  With a low-latency interface, these
  configurations could potentially be updated quickly in response to
  traffic changes.

If you have new ideas, please let me know!
